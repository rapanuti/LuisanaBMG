Hi! I am a Systems Engineering student with a deep passion for backend development. My goal is to specialize in this area to build robust and efficient systems. 

I consider myself a very responsible and organized person, qualities that I consider essential to ensure that each project is successful. Although my main interest is in backend development, I also have a healthy curiosity for databases. I am convinced that understanding how data is managed and optimized is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of the applications I develop.

I am always looking to learn and improve my skills, and I love facing new challenges in the programming world. My goal is to continue to grow as a developer and contribute innovative solutions that make a difference. üíªü§©
